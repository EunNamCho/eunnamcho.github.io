## About Me

I am a master's student at SungKyunKwan University (SKKU), advised by Prof. Sungeun Hong.
My research focuses on object detection, instance segmentation, and amodal perception, with a recent interest in autonomous driving and robotics.
I am particularly motivated by developing efficient and robust AI systems that can generalize to real-world environments.
