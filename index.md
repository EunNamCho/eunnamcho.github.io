## About Me

I am a master's student at SungKyunKwan University (SKKU), advised by Prof. Sungeun Hong.
My research focuses on object detection, instance segmentation, and amodal perception, with a recent interest in autonomous driving and robotics.
I am particularly motivated by developing efficient and robust AI systems that can generalize to real-world environments.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning
